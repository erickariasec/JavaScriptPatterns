# How Patterns.dev works  

We publish patterns, tips and tricks for improving how you architect apps for free. Keep in mind, design patterns are descriptive, not prescriptive. They can guide you when facing a problem other developers have encountered many times before, but are not a blunt tool for jamming into every scenario. Patterns.dev aims to be a catalog of patterns (for increasing awareness) rather than a checklist (what you must do).

## Powerful suite of patterns

Design patterns are a fundamental part of software development, as they provide typical solutions to commonly recurring problems in software design.  

- ES2017+  
The implementation, benefits and pitfalls of common design patterns using ES2017+.

- Optimized for React developers  
React-specific design patterns and their possible modification and implementation using React Hooks.

- A focus on Web Performance  
...and many more Web Performance patterns and optimizations that can help improve your modern web app!.  

## Modern perspective on patterns  

A common critique of design patterns is that they needlessly add complexity.

Our perspective is that patterns are valuable for solving specific problems, often helping to communicate comminalities in code problems for humans. If a project doesn't have those problems, there isn't a need to apply them. Patterns can also be very language or framework-specific (e.g. React), which can often mean thinking beyond the scope of just the original GoF design patterns.
